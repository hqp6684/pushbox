RAILS-
	controller is to receive specific requests for the app
	routeing decides which controller receives which requests
	There is often more than one route to each controller
	Different routes can be served by different actions
	Each action is to collect information to provide to view
	View is to display data

	to create new controller
		rails generate controller name action
	
	to route to the root -> edit routes.rb

A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects
**You need to add the resouce to the routes.rb
	example: resouces :articles

	render hash -> create a page
	example:
	def create
		render plain: params[:article].inspect
	end
		render method takes in hash key of plain with 
		params[:article].inspect

by default, ruby works in the development environment. 
So, when migrate, it will change the development database in config/databse
If want to execute migrations in production or other environment, must be
explicitly pass it when invoking migrate 
	example : rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

Strong parameters, 
	@article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title,:text)
CRUD actions in each controller: index, show, new, edit, create, update, destroy
CRUD actions are public, and need to be placed before any private or protected methods in the controller

	link_to recepes
	linkt_to 'name' action_controller_path
<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>
